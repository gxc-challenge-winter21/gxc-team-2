We are a team of four stundets that were given a challenge of Deutsche Bahn. On the [following pages](https://github.com/gxc-challenge-winter21/gxc-team-2/wiki) you can learn who we are, what the challenge was and how we solved it.

YouÂ´ll find everything you need to know and more.

Spoiler: We even created a prototype for an app to visualise our solution!

**Have Fun!**
